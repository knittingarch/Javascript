// To let mother cows rest, the cowboy-devs at the Plains of Prototypes have decided only to breed cows that have not given birth to any calves yet.

// Now they want to add some functionality to the Object prototype itself. Theyâ€™ve asked you to build two functions, in order:

// First, build a function called noCalvesYet, which will be added to the Object prototype.
// If the object type is a "cow" and also had no calves, the function should return a true value. Otherwise it should return a false value.
// Then, build a function called countForBreeding, which will be added to the Array prototype.
// In countForBreeding start by creating a numToBreed counter variable. The following steps refer to code in countForBreeding.
// Use a for loop to loop through all of the array values. You can use this to refer to the current list.
// Call noCalvesYet(). If it returns true for the current array value, then that means the cows are not moms, and we can increment the numToBreed counter variable.
// After your loop, this function should return the numToBreed count, which represents how many non-mother cows are available within any array.
